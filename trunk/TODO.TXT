TODO List:
==========================
1. handle anonymous structs, for example:

typedef struct {
	int a;
} StamStruct;

This will appear as two entries in the symbol tree/database:

___anony1  --> For the actual struct
     a

StamStruct --> For the typedef

If name contains __anony* try to replace it with the typedef name

2. ******** FIXED ********* Gather all macros under a single entry in the symbol tree
