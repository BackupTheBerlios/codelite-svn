TODO List:
==========================
1.
handle anonymous structs, for example:

typedef struct {
	int a;
} StamStruct;

This will appear as two entries in the symbol tree/database:

___anony1  --> For the actual struct
     a

StamStruct --> For the typedef

If name contains __anony* try to replace it with the typedef name

2. 
Gather all macros under a single entry in the symbol tree

3. Change the default icon from class to struct (the case for typedef struct {} Somthing is much more common than class)
4. Add option to search for single symbol (like eclips's Ctrl+Shift+O)
5. Add option to open resource in the document
6. Replace the editor default menu 
7. Add Tags options dialog that will allow user to do the following:
	- Add external database to the current workspace
	- Create database from source
	- Select language for the parser (ctags)
	- Allow user to set list of macros that will be ignored by ctags

8. Indentation bug: when pressing enter, the caret goes to the end of the line
9. Add other lexers other than C++
10. Save layout
11. Move options from the xml file to the editor
12. When using editor, write in status bar the current line and column.
13. Add toolbar
